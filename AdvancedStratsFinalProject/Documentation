Mouse Gesture API Documentation

By: Andy Tran and Kellan who didn't do shit

This API streamlines common mouse gestures found in games. Features include
dragging, flicking, double clicking, and long pressing. The modules are built
by breaking each gestures into distinct states of that gesture and allowing
the user to pass in callback functions in each state.

The API requires a camera to track mouse position with certain gestures, which
can be set through the setCamera function. In order to "activate" each gesture,
the corresponding check function (for example, checkForFlick for the flick gesture)
must be called in the current scene's update function.
